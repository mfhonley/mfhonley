**16 · Developer · Almaty**

I started programming in 8th grade when I realized I wanted to build not just something useful, but something that people would know was made by me. I wanted people to recognize my creations and value my contribution to society.

## Journey

My first project was a Telegram bot for school. I remember the feeling when the first hundred people started using it. It was amazing to realize that people were actually using what I built.

Then I started taking freelance orders while still in school, participated in informatics and database olympiads. Later came hackathons — winning prizes, including making it to the NASA Space Apps Challenge finals out of 8,000 teams (October 2024).

Found my first job — worked at Traffy, Asquids, and various Telegram Mini Apps projects. Worked with blockchain, built a crypto payment gateway that's still being used today. After that, worked at a fintech company where I dove even deeper into this space.

Summer 2025, got into nFactorial Incubator, made it to Demo Day among 80 projects. [menoai.site](https://menoai.site) reached 800+ users, but decided to move on, not seeing a future in the project.

## CatOps

Decided to pivot to DevOps, building CatOps — AI-powered monitoring for developers. Saw the problem in my own projects: it takes too long to set up monitoring and make sure the project doesn't crash. Especially for startups, time is money, and spending it on infrastructure setup is pretty stupid.

**Features:**
- Quick setup for startups
- AI-powered analysis and solutions
- Telegram integration
- Open Source — 40+ stars

**Tech:** Go, AI/ML, DevOps

## Almaty

At the same time, moved from my parents' place to Almaty at 16 and got a job as a developer at one of the companies that offered me a position. Decided to explore something new.

Yes, it was sad leaving family, friends, girlfriend, and home. But I believe it was worth it and will pay off.
